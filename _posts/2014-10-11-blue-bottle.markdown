It worked. Tonx was acquired by [Blue Bottle Coffee](http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com) of Oakland, and six months later without a hint of pain or confusion, my Tonx sbscription was transmogrified to a Blue Bottle subscription. With Blue Bottle, a really cool thing is that I can now choose between different types of coffee to subscribe to. The first shipment arrived this week, 12oz of Roman Espresso.

Nice job, Blue Bottle!
