I live in fear.

Fear of data loss, that is. I've never had a memory card fail on me, but I work hard to ensure I'll lose a minimum of data that if that happens. My backup strategy is pretty simple, but I think it's effective and adds only a small amount of overhead.

I'm using cameras that feature dual memory card slots. The Canon 5D Mark III and 5D Mark IV both have an SD slot and a CF slot. I configure the camera to write images (RAW or JPG, depending on what I'm shooting) to both slots simultaneously, so should a single one of those cards fail during shooting, there's a backup on the other card. I typically use 32GB SD cards, and 64GB CF cards, and I swap out the SD card after each day's shoot. I usually shoot a few GB max in a single day, so a single 64GB CF card can absorb many days worth of backup images.

At the end of a day of shooting I do two things. First, I swap the SD card out of the camera and replace it with a blank one. This means I'll use several SD cards if I'm out for multiple days.

Second, I back up the card I just removed from the camera onto a portable hard disk. I use a [WD My Passport Wireless](http://a.co/htl8Wi3) drive to copy images from the SD card. I have the previous model of the My Passport Wireless and it works great. That said, it is quite slow at copying images and streaming them over WiFi. [Reviewers say](https://www.dpreview.com/reviews/wd-my-passport-wireless-pro) the latest model linked above is much faster.
Once the copy is complete I store the "exposed" SD card in this [rugged memory card case](http://a.co/6D4wOl4).

This approach gives me 2 offline backups of images (the "exposed" SD card and the hard disk) as well as an online backup (the CF card in the camera). I'm still hosed if I drop my camera in a river before the day's images are backed up. But other than that disaster scenario, this strategy should work well.
