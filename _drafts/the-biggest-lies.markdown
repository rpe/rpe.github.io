The corporate world is full of maxims, mantras, aphorisms, and clichés. 
If you've been around for a while, you've heard more than a few of these. 
You may have been beaten about the head with one of these saws by a 
particularly zealous colleague or manager. I hope one of them wasn't me.

Here are a few juicy ones:

> "You can't manage what you can't measure." <sup>1</sup>
>
> "The tyranny of the OR." <sup>2</sup>
>
> "Never get involved in a land war in Asia." <sup>3</sup>

Each of these pithy little nuggets is rooted in truth. And each has been
trotted out by an ambitious manager who doesn't really understand what the
underlying truth is, and used as a blunt instrument 
while driving some other agenda. Like any short hand, these aphorisms need
to be understood deeply if the underlying concepts are to be useful as a
management tool.

Here are a few clichés that managers love to use, which can range from out and out
lies (though possibly not conscious ones) to thin veneers papering over a 
completely different behavior. And sometimes when people say these
things they are actually true!

> "I value results, not activity."
>
> "I'm not a micro-manager."
>
> "I only hire 'A' players."
>
> "Sure, we're a big company now, but we still operate like a startup."

In the next few posts I will take a closer look at each of these statements.
