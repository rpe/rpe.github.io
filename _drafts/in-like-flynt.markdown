Back in North Carolina I had a friend named Alex. Alex drove a gigantic
blue land yacht, an old New Yorker that might have made 8 miles per gallon
on a good day. And Alex was a great guy.

He was the kind of guy, had he grown up 40 years previous, who would
have been called "Moose" by his buddies. Big and burly, with the
personality of a teddy bear, Alex probably defused as many altercations 
as he helped start.

Alex was the kind of amazingly selfless guy we all wish we could be.
He'd drive across the state to pick up somebody he'd just met from
college and deliver them to their parents' house. When my sister visited
for the first time, he volunteered to take her on a day-long tour 
of the city.
