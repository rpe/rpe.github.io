Back in North Carolina I had a friend named Alex. Alex drove a gigantic
blue land yacht, an ancient New Yorker that might have made 8 miles per gallon
on a good day. And Alex was a great guy.

He was the kind of guy, had he grown up 30 years previous, who would
have been called "Moose" by his buddies. Big and burly, with the
personality of a teddy bear, Alex probably defused as many altercations 
as he helped start.

Alex was the kind of amazingly selfless guy we all wish we could be.
He'd drive across the state to pick up somebody he'd just met from
college and deliver them to their parents' house. When my sister visited
for the first time, he took her on a day-long tour of the city, including
a trip to the top of the Holiday Inn (apparently a big deal in Raleigh back in the day).

Alex would chauffeur us everywhere we needed to go, happy to be the designated
driver for a bunch of twenty-something idiots intent on having a good time.
He had a saying he liked to use. When things were going our way, when we
were slicing through life (or a nightclub) like the proverbial hot knife through butter,
he'd say, "man, we are in like Flint."

Not willing to leave well enough alone, I pulled Alex aside after hearing him
deliver this phrase a few times.
"Alex," I said, "it's 'In like Flynn.' The saying is referring to Errol Flynn,
the notorious partier and ladies man popular in the 30's and 40's."
He looked back at me with benevolence, the way one might kindly regard
a confused puppy or child.
"Rob," he said, "sorry buddy, but it's 'In like Flint.' Get it right."

The last time I saw Alex he was selling insurance door-to-door. 
He stopped by my place and pitched me on some kind of insurance policy
or annuity. I heard him out, and politely agreed to think about it.
I haven't seen him since.

Alex, if you're out there, I hope life is treating you well.
I hope you're in like Flint.
