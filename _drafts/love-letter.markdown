I'm in love with Fujifilm X-series cameras.

It all started with the X100S. For two weeks in June, the [X100S](https://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x100s/) came to Italy 
with my wife and me. It traveled, unobtrusively, from Liguria to Tuscany to Florence,
was at home in museums, on cafe tables, in churches. In silent mode this camera
is so quiet you can scarcely hear the shutter; it is perfect for
quiet spaces and street photography.

The X100S retro design really resonates.
During our Italy trip, multiple people asked me if I was shooting 
film with an old rangefinder, which was kind of cool. 

I was so impressed with the fixed-lens X100S that I purchased an [X-E2](https://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_e2/) 
and a few lenses. The X-E2 continues the rangefinder aesthetic of the X100S, 
but with interchangeable lenses. 
The Fujinon lenses, particularly the 35mm f/1.4 and 23mm f/1.4, are exceptional.
The X-E2 sports the same 16MP APS-C sensor as the X100S and its images are gorgeous.
The X-E2 has been my every day carry camera since it arrived, and the X100S
now travels with my wife. Mostly.

Fuji recently released the [X-T1](https://www.fujifilmusa.com/products/digital_cameras/x/fujifilm_x_t1/), 
which uses the same sensor as the X-E2 but is styled like an SLR and features
a very large EVF, improved continuous autofocus, articulating screen, and weather sealing.
The X-T1 garnered glowing reviews.

What about Sony, Olympus, Panasonic, and the like? Frankly, they all make
great cameras. The latest mirrorless systems all have terrific image
quality and large(ish) sensors. The differences between manufacturers are mostly in 
design and usability, and in this respect Fuji has it nailed. An X-series camera feels,
well, like a camera. If you're comfortable with a shutter speed dial and an
aperture ring, Ã  la 35mm Rangefinders and SLRs, you'll love the Fujis.

Another area where Fuji appears to be focusing is customer service. Their
software upgrades add significant functionality to X-series bodies and lenses,
in some cases long after the products have shipped. For example, in late 2013, Fuji updated 
the X100 to add focus peaking and improve autofocus speed by 20%. This
is remarkable considering the X100 had
been discontinued (and replaced by the X100S) months before.
Superior support will build some serious customer loyalty for Fujifilm.

Some have said [Fuji is the new Leica](http://zackarias.com/for-photographers/gear-gadgets/fuji-x100s-review-a-camera-walks-into-a-bar/), and I'm hard pressed to disagree.


but advanced autofocus eludes mirrorless
5d3 for lacrosse
to be fair, it's a $3600 camera
to say nothing of a 1DX (don't have one, won't buy one)
and other than action sports mirrorless is friggin awesome
hope to see mirrorless systems catching up with autofocus soon

because I use a Canon 5D Mark III for sports, and therefore don't 
need the improved continuous focus (as great as the X-series is, it can't
compete with the autofocus on high end DSLR's--yet).
