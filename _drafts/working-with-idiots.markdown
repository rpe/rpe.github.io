So it’s happened. Your company hired a new VP/director/manager/engineer in an area that impacts you directly, and the guy is a total idiot. He’s making bad decisions, alienating you and other employees, and proving to be a complete non-fit for the company culture. You’re about to storm into your boss’ office and declare this guy the biggest hiring mistake since the Giants signed Barry Zito. Hold on. You have three options.


### 1. Check Yourself

I’ve worked in companies where the culture, particularly in engineering, is to assume that anyone who doesn’t agree with you is an idiot. Turns out that’s not always the case. In fact, it’s usually not the case.

If it looks like the new guy is a moron, take a step back. What are his assumptions? What data is he working with? What are his goals and incentives? What’s his background prior to joining your company? No doubt some or all of these things are different than you assume, and if you’re able to better understand where your idiot is coming from, maybe he won’t look like such an idiot.


### 2. Wait

If you’re not wrong (ie. he is an idiot), or you’re not sure (ie. he might be an idiot), the best next move is to wait. If the dude really is a moron, the company’s management chain should flush him (bad execs usually last longer than bad engineers, unfortunately). If your company is not strongly managed and is unable to get rid of bad hires, you have a larger problem to solve.

The “wait” option is when you should go talk to your boss. One of my companies hired a C-level executive who was immediately tagged an idiot by the engineers on my team. This person had been very successful in previous companies, but he wasn’t able to gel in his new role. It wasn’t long before I had engineers and managers parading into my office complaining about this individual and his lack of clue. I told them all to wait, that if it was as bad as they were claiming it would sort itself out. And it did. He was gone within a year, and off to a very successful rest of his career.


### 3. Leave

If all else fails, bail out. Nobody should have to work for, or with, an idiot. Be sure your manager knows how you feel well in advance of you committing to leave the company. It’s very likely she will want to find you another role inside the company than see you leave outright. But in the end, life is short. Work with great people. If your company wants you to work with idiots, get out.
