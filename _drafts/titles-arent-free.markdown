> Titles are important because they help establish credibility with people who don’t know you. They help shape an organization and give form to managerial and technical growth paths.

> Titles are not important because words are meaningless. You’re capable at your job or you’re not, no matter what your business card says.

Maybe you subscribe to one of the above views. I’m not here to persuade you to take either position, but I’ll give you some true facts from the hiring trenches.

Every week, I meet people who are concerned about what title 
they’ll get if they’re hired by my company.
Most of these people work at big public companies.
And most of them are not directors, and might be soon, at their current company.

The unfortunate truth is that a director title is not all champagne and roses. 
There are some nice things about being a director at a big public company. 

1. The title confers meaningful status at similar companies.
2. You’ll get a raise and better bonus target.
3. Your mother-in-law might acknowledge you. Finally.

There are also some downsides.

1. You’re officially middle management. Guess who gets whacked first when the hammer comes down?
2. Once you’re out on the street, finding another director role is much harder than finding a manager role. It took years of sweat to get the title, but guess what? Directors on the job market are a dime a dozen.
3. You run the danger of becoming a lifer at your company.

In my role as a hiring manager at a startup, I’ve interviewed many 
directors from big public companies who had no idea how to get 
meaningful work done.
They’d lost their edge.
Presumably they were passable in their current jobs but they’d 
lost relevancy in the technology industry at large.

They had become lifers at their company, or at best 
could swim between similar employers in the same industry.
I saw so much of this job rot that I will not recruit from a big 
company unless I get a referral from a known source.

There’s another issue with concern about titles. 
It tells me that you’re more concerned with optics than with delivering awesome shit. 
That’s a huge red flag.

If you want to be a director, go for it. 
But stay hungry and keep delivering awesome shit.
