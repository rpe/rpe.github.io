> "I only hire 'A' players."

Of course you do.

We all aspire to build best teams in our respective industries. A huge part of that is
hiring the very best individual for each role.
I mean, come on, who's going to trumpet "we only hire 'C+' players"? Iamiright?

So how *do* you hire 'A' players?

There are volumes of information on the topic and if you're handy with a library card or google you can immerse yourself in the theory and data about recruiting.

There are three parts to the puzzle.

1. Build a strong candidate pipeline.
2. Build a structured and repeatable interview capability.
3. Fix your mistakes.

### The Pipeline

Building a strong pipeline of potential hires and managing those candidates through recruiting process is a critical part of any companies ability to execute on its vision.

### Interviewing

Two words: behavioral interviews.

[Google has analyzed](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html) data on tens of thousands of internal interviews and concluded that there is no correlation between future job performance and the typical factors: GPA, school attended, prior experience, and performance in the interview itself. A former google employee told me that the only thing that tends to correlate with job performance is internal referrals (in other words, people referred by your current employees tend to perform well).

The best way to conduct interviews is to use structured, behavioral interviewing techniques. Be sure every interviewer knows what area they should cover. Give each interviewer a script, if necessary. It is important that you can repeat these behavioral interviews so you're getting a consistent read on each candidate.

Assess motivation, team fit, and xxxx.
