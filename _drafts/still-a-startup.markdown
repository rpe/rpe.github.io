"Sure, we're a big company now, but we still operate like a startup."

...is probably the most common lie told during job interviews in Silicon Valley. At least it's the one I've told most often. How many times have you heard it? How many times have you told it?

The origin of this deceit lies in the denial that things have changed. Your small, successful company has grown up, and along with the growth have come more processes to keep track of larger teams, more mature products, and more customers. As with most lies, it's better to face the truth than to continue telling the lie (actually, that's true for all lies). The reckoning will come, eventually.

Telling prospective employees (and yourself) that you're still a startup does a huge disservice to your company. You're misleading candidates about what working at your company is really like, and that false advertising will come back to bite you. You are also denying yourself the opportunity to help your bigger company do its best work.

To be clear, I'm not saying that all big companies will become process encrusted, change averse dinosaurs. In fact there are many contemporary examples of [large companies that keep their teams agile and process to a minimum](http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-10-10/jeff-bezos-and-the-age-of-amazon-excerpt-from-the-everything-store-by-brad-stone). But it should be clear that some things will change as your company grows. Face the truth and give yourself the chance to develop the best ways of working as you grow.

If this message is hard to swallow, there is another way to stop the wishful thinking. Join a startup. I did.
