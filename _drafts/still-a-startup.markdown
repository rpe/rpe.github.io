"Sure, we're a big company now, but we still operate like a startup."



hear it all the time
how many times have you heard it
what are the symptoms
how to diagnose

if you are at a large company and find yourself saying this, maybe it is wishful thinking
don't tell it to candidates, false advertising
maybe you should go join a startup
