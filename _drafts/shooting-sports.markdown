As much as [I love the new mirrorless cameras](http://rpe.me), there's one use case where they come up lacking: sports. The auto-focus systems in cameras like the Canon 5D Mark III, 7D, and 1D series make a huge difference to getting quality images in action sports like lacrosse and soccer.

My 5D Mark II had relatively rudimentary autofocus and it was crap at sticking focus on fast-moving players. I have no experience with recent Nikon DSLRs but I'm sure their top cameras have badass autofocus like the fancy Canons.

To be fair to mirrorless, I've seen [some reasonable sports shots](http://confessionsxl.com/blog/first-impressions-of-the-fujifilm-x-e2/) from the Fujifilm X-E2, and early reports of the X-T1 say its doing an even better job of continuous autofocus tracking (I plan to rent one to find out more). And while we're being fair, a 5D Mark III and 70-200 f/2.8 IS will set you back about $5600, while an X-E2 and 50-200 f/3.5-4.8 is around $1400.<sup>1</sup> Like most things in life, you get what you pay for.

I want to see mirrorless close the gap with focus speed and tracking. Fuji and Olympus are moving quickly. The next few years in mirrorless will be fun to watch.
