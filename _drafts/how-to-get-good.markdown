Strong engineering teams are of course built with strong
engineering talent. If you've just landed in your first job
out of school, you might reasonably ask yourself, "How do I get
to be strong engineering talent?"

You did your homework. You studied, and wrote exams.
You can field questions on the work of Claude Shannon, and prove that the 
problem of finding your socks on Monday morning is O(N * log N). 
But now you've been asked to design features in an existing code base,
build tests, and most importantly, don't break stuff.
Your current skills are necessary, but not sufficient.

It never hurts to be naturally gifted. Bestowed, as it were, with an
otherworldly talent for design and coding. If you're that person,
awesome ([call me](http://twitter.com/barque)). 
Most of us aren't; we have to get good and asymptotically 
approach awesomeness over time. Here's how it's done.

1. **Take responsibility for your own development**.
Big companies will send you to training courses and offer
you career guidance. That's all bullshit, unless you like donuts.
Nobody cares about you as much as you do. Own your own
development and make it happen. 

2. **Focus**. Pick an aspect of your job and get better
at that. Then pick another.

3. **Get a mentor**.
Find the best person in you know in the area you want to improve on.
Maybe it's a developer one cube over from you, maybe it's an
executive in another part of the company.

4. **Emulate**.
Then understand.

5. **GOTO 2**;

### Mentoring ###

How do you make somebody your mentor? It's pretty easy, and you don't 
even have to tell them (but it's better if you do).



Does it mean you spend days with them, clad only in loin cloths,
eating berries?



Real development happens in the trenches.
