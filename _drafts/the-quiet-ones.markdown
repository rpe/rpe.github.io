A colleague of mine has a story he uses to demonstrate one of the key points of 
engineering management. 

A few years ago he was attending an all hands meeting hosted by his Engineering VP. As part of the meeting, the VP lauded a number of engineers for working around the clock to solve 
a quality issue found by a customer. Each engineer was identified by name, and thanked 
for going above and beyond to make the customer whole.

Customer happiness should the top priority of any business, so if a customer 
was experiencing issues with the product, of course the engineers should jump
on the case and resolve the issues as quickly as possible.

That being said, what's wrong with this picture?

After the presentation, my friend asked the VP what the 
best selling feature of the product was. "It's the L2 functionality", the VP said
(you guessed it, the feature that my friend helped create).

"How many bugs do customers find in that feature?", my colleague asked.

"Not many", replied the VP.

"So how do I get my name recognized at the all hands?", was the next question.

This is an example of the squeaky wheel problem. The engineers that
pulled the all-nighter were fixing bugs in their own work, dealing with
customer issues that they had a hand in creating. They were recognized by the
executive as being the ones willing to go above and beyond for the company.
The engineers that built a more stable (and widely deployed and profitable) feature
were ignored.

It's an easy mistake to make. Of course the engineers that went above and beyond should
be recognized. Some number of bugs are bound to be found in the field, and
people who jump in and save customers should be celebrated.

But what about the quiet ones, the engineers who design, build, and test the 
stable features that bring revenue quarter after quarter?

Don't forget them. They deserve every bit as much praise as the squeaky wheels.
