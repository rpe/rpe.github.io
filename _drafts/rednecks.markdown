If you ask somebody to do a task, and then spend 5 minutes describing how they should go about doing it, you might be a micro-manager.

If an employee tells you something, and you routinely follow up with 5 minutes of questions looking for details you don't really need, you might be a micro-manager.

If you check in twice a day on the progress of a task, you might be a micro-manager.

If you frequently attend the same meetings as people that report to you, you might be a micro-manager.

If you mow your lawn and find a car, well... in that case, I suppose [you might be a redneck](http://www.jefffoxworthy.com/jokes).

"But," you say, "I know the right way to get the task done, so I'm just helping my people out when I tell them how to do it." 
Fair enough. But there are a couple of issues here. First, consider that you might not know the best way to get a particular task done---if you dictate the "how", then you'll never find out if there is a better way. And more importantly, if you dictate
the how, you're removing growth opportunities for your people. Let them figure out how to do things, and if they make
a few mistakes along the way, so be it. Ask for the "what" and not the "how", and you'll end up with a team capable
of much more.

"But," you say, "I sweat the details and when a deliverable comes in I need to know everything about it so I know it's been done right." News flash: that's not sweating the details. That's micro-managing.

Here's how you sweat the details without going over the top. When you hand out a task, describe what success looks like. In other words, what are the parameters that must be present in the solution. Other than that, the person responsible for delivering should have free reign to get the work done as she sees fit.

It should go without saying that this is the right way to grow a strong team, one that is capable of surprising you with 
its output and creativity.

And of course, it should also go without saying that good people won't work for micro-managers. At least, not for long. Give your people the room to grow and explore. Assume they're great, point them in the right direction and get out of their way.
